## Project Overview

### What is Code Matrix?
Code Matrix is a modern, AI-powered online judge platform designed to help programmers practice competitive programming and improve their coding skills. Think of it as a digital gym for your programming muscles, where you can solve problems, get instant feedback, and receive AI-powered hints when you're stuck.

### Why Code Matrix?
In today's competitive programming landscape, learners often struggle with:
- **Getting unstuck**: When you're confused about a problem approach
- **Learning from mistakes**: Understanding why your solution failed
- **Progressive learning**: Finding the right difficulty level
- **Instant feedback**: Waiting for human mentors or community help

Code Matrix solves these problems by integrating Google's Gemini AI to provide instant, contextual help while maintaining the challenge and learning value of problem-solving.

### Key Features
- **Problem Library**: Curated collection of coding problems with varying difficulty levels
- **Multi-language Support**: Python, C++, C, and Java compilation and execution
- **AI Assistant**: Gemini-powered hints and code analysis without giving away solutions
- **Real-time Testing**: Test your code against sample cases before submission
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your solving streak, acceptance rate, and improvement
- **Clean UI/UX**: Bootstrap-powered responsive design that works on all devices

### Architectural Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each app handles a specific domain (problems, submissions, accounts, AI)
2. **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
3. **Security First**: Environment variables, CSRF protection, secure headers
4. **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, proper naming conventions
5. **Performance**: Database optimization, static file compression

### 2. Database Design

#### **Core Models**
```python
# Problems Model - The Foundation
class Problem:
    - title: String (e.g., "Two Sum")
    - description: Text (Problem statement)
    - difficulty: Choice (Easy/Medium/Hard)
    - time_limit: Integer (execution time limit)
    - memory_limit: Integer (memory usage limit)
    - created_at: DateTime
    - is_active: Boolean

# TestCase Model - The Truth
class TestCase:
    - problem: ForeignKey to Problem
    - input_data: Text (what goes into the program)
    - expected_output: Text (what should come out)
    - is_sample: Boolean (visible to users or hidden)

# Submission Model - The Attempt
class Submission:
    - user: ForeignKey to User
    - problem: ForeignKey to Problem
    - source_code: Text (user's solution)
    - language: Choice (Python/C++/C/Java)
    - verdict: Choice (AC/WA/TLE/CE/RE)
    - execution_time: Integer (milliseconds)
    - memory_used: Integer (bytes)
    - submitted_at: DateTime
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Problem Solving Flow
```
User visits problem → Reads description → Writes code → Tests locally → Submits → Gets verdict
                                           ↓
                                    AI Assistant provides hints if requested
```

### 2. Code Execution Pipeline
```
Code Submission → Language Detection → File Creation → Compilation → Execution → Output Comparison → Verdict
```

### 3. AI Assistance Flow
```
User requests help → Context sent to Gemini → AI analyzes → Helpful hint returned → Displayed to user
```

## Security & Best Practices

### 1. **Environment Variables**
All sensitive information is stored in environment variables:
- API keys (Google Gemini)
- Database credentials
- Django secret keys
- Debug settings

### 2. **Code Execution Security**
- **Sandboxing**: Code runs in isolated temporary files
- **Time Limits**: 5-second execution timeout prevents infinite loops
- **Resource Limits**: Memory usage monitoring
- **File Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of temporary files

### 3. **Web Security**
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Secure Headers**: XSS protection, content type options
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Authentication**: Required for code submission

### 4. **API Security**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of AI assistance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure without exposing internals
- **Input Sanitization**: Clean data before sending to external APIs

## Deployment Architecture

### **Production Environment**
```
Internet → Render Load Balancer → Gunicorn → Django App → PostgreSQL
                                     ↓
                                 WhiteNoise (Static Files)
```

### **Key Deployment Features**
1. **Automatic Builds**: Git push triggers deployment
2. **Environment Management**: Separate dev/prod configurations
3. **Database Migrations**: Automatic on deployment
4. **Static File Serving**: WhiteNoise for efficient delivery
5. **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring

### **Build Process**
1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. Render detects changes
3. Dependencies installed
4. Database migrations run
5. Static files collected
6. Application restarted

## AI Integration

### **Gemini Service Architecture**
The AI assistant is designed to be helpful but not give away solutions:

#### **Hint Generation**
```python
# The AI receives:
- Problem title and description
- User's programming language preference
- Context about what kind of help is needed

# The AI provides:
- Algorithmic approach hints
- Data structure suggestions
- Edge case considerations
- NOT the actual code solution
```

#### **Code Analysis**
```python
# When code fails, AI analyzes:
- The failed code
- The problem description
- Test case results
- Error messages

# AI provides:
- Debugging suggestions
- Logic error identification
- Performance improvement tips
```

### **AI Safety Measures**
1. **No Solution Spoiling**: AI is instructed never to provide complete solutions
2. **Educational Focus**: Hints guide learning rather than giving answers
3. **Context Awareness**: AI understands the educational nature of the platform
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overuse and ensures thoughtful problem-solving
