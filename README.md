```python
# User struggling with "Two Sum" problem
AI Response: "Consider using a hash map to store numbers you've seen. 
As you iterate through the array, check if the complement 
(target - current number) exists in your hash map."
```

### 🔍 **Code Analysis**
```python
# For Wrong Answer verdicts
AI Response: "Your logic looks correct, but check edge cases. 
What happens when the array has duplicate numbers? 
Consider if your solution handles negative numbers properly."
```

```python
# For Runtime Errors
AI Response: "The IndexError suggests you're accessing an array 
index that doesn't exist. Check your loop bounds and ensure 
you're not going beyond array length-1."
